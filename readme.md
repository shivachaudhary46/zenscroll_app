# Hi, I am Zenscroll üëã

I am an app created to empower and protect youth online by addressing the real issues of trolling, toxicity, and mental health risks in digital spaces. My mission is to make your scrolling experience safer, kinder, and more mindful.

---

## üåê What Problems Do I Solve?

- Online trolls and toxic comments are everywhere, affecting youth globally.
- Mental health risks such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness are rising due to social media harassment.
- Current tools just block content or ignore emotional well-being‚Äîyouth need guidance, not just filters, to navigate online spaces safely.

---

## üöÄ What Can I Do?

- **Detect** trolling, harassment, and harmful comments in real time while you scroll.
- **Shield** you by filtering or hiding toxic content before you see it.
- **Guide** you with positive coping tips, fact-based responses, or gentle prompts to ignore and move on.
- **Encourage** mindful scrolling, sending alerts when you've been scrolling too long or engaging with negativity.
- **Build resilience** through mini in-app activities to boost mood and self-esteem.
